                    <p>
                        Professionally, I navigate the technical demands of water irrigation systems as a
                        technician and inside-sales to contractor serving West Jordan, UT. This hands-on role
                        has honed my ability to diagnose issues, implement practical solutions, and understand
                        client needs. I'm now
                        channeling that dedication into a new chapter, actively pursuing a software development
                        education with BYU Pathway Worldwide to
                        build innovative solutions in the tech landscape. At the heart of everything I do is my
                        family,I'm a committed husband and a proud dad to three incredible triplet girls, who
                        teach me resilience and perspective
                        every day. My interests provide balance and inspiration. Drawing allows me a creative
                        outlet, while
                        movies offer escape and storytelling. Tennis keeps me active and sharpens my strategic
                        thinking. I'm naturally curious
                        and love discovering new places, which fuels my understanding of diverse needs and
                        solutions. Ultimately, whether it's optimizing a sprinkler system, writing clean code,
                        or simply lending a hand,
                        I'm driven by a desire to apply my expertise to make a tangible, positive difference for
                        people.
